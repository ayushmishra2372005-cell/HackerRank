# Number Line Jumps

![Difficulty](https://img.shields.io/badge/Difficulty-Easy-green)

## Problem

You are choreographing a circus show with various animals. For one act, you are given two kangaroos on a number line ready to jump in the positive direction (i.e, toward positive infinity). 

- The first kangaroo starts at location $x1$ and moves at a rate of $v1$ meters per jump. 
- The second kangaroo starts at location $x2$ and moves at a rate of $v2$ meters per jump.

You have to figure out a way to get both kangaroos at the same location at the same time  as part of the show.  If it is possible, return `YES`, otherwise return `NO`.  

**Example**  
$x1 = 2$   
$v1 = 1$   
$x2 = 1$   
$v2 = 2$   

After one jump, they are both at $x = 3$, ($x1 + v1 = 2 + 1$, $x2 + v2 = 1 + 2$), so the answer is `YES`.

**Function Description**

Complete the function *kangaroo* in the editor below.    

kangaroo has the following parameter(s):  

- *int x1, int v1*: starting position and jump distance for kangaroo 1
- *int x2, int v2*: starting position and jump distance for kangaroo 2   

**Returns**   

- *string:* either `YES` or `NO`


**Input Format**

A single line of four space-separated integers denoting the respective values of $x1$, $v1$, $x2$, and $v2$.

**Constraints**

- $0 \le x1 < x2 \le 10000$  
- $1 \le v1 \le 10000$  
- $1 \le v2 \le 10000$  

**Output Format**

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    int x1, v1, x2, v2;
    cin >> x1 >> v1 >> x2 >> v2;
    if (v1 > v2 && (x2 - x1) % (v1 - v2) == 0) 
    {
        cout << "YES" << endl;
    } 
    else 
    {
        cout << "NO" << endl;
    }
    
    return 0;
}

```
